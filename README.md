# ME : My Editor
*"Just ME and my code"*

----

## About
ME is a text editor written in Javascript using Node-Webkit and Ace-editor.  
It aims to do what I wanted an editor to do, nothing more or less. At the moment, there are only basic fonctions, but I aim to improve all this.  
I love Sublime Text, but it is too "decorative" for me. I love Zed, but you can't build your project or execute shell commands. A few little things, but enough to make my own editor.  

> I just wanted to transmit my mind to people : *If anything annoy you, stop growling. Make it by yourself.*  
At least, If you don't succeed, you will be aware how hard people worked to do it, else you could have your own tool, perfectly shaped for you.

This editor is not perfect, but it fits to me. So, you can fork it and modify it as long as you respect the license (see below).

## How it works

Be sure to have Node-Webkit installed, and execute in the folder :

`nw .`

You are now ready to open a file and write code.

## Commands

* **CTRL-Escape** : quit
* **CTRL-SHIFT-H** : show/hide header (allows you to move window)
* **CTRL-O** : open a file
* **CTRL-S** : quick-save
* **CTRL-W** : save file by setting its name
* **CTRL-M** : make
* **CTRL-B** : execute shell command
